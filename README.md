A web based front end for deployment of SilverStripe sites.

## Overview

Deploynaut is a blend of SilverStripe code that is calling [Capistrano 2](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/) recipies to manage deployment of other SilverStripe sites.

The main design considerations have been:

 - Easy and carefree deployments for non-technical (and technical) people
 - Easy configuration and setup of new environments via a web ui

## Installation and configuration

See [docs](docs/en/index.md).
